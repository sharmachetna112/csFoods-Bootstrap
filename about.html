            Chetna Sharma!
            And csFoods is my little corner of the internet!
            <hr>
            I'm the voice, author, and creator behind csFoods. What started as a casual hobby over 4 years ago in 2019 while I was a student of higher secondary has now grown into a full-blown business that reaches millions of people with fun recipes each month, with content that has been featured on The Kitchn. Travel is also a big interest for mine. I venture out around the globe a few times a year to share her experiences and hotel reviews .</p>

        <p class="lead">In this space, I am always sharing fresh, flavorful, (mostly) healthy recipes that I love to make and eat in my real, actual, every day life. If I wouldn’t eat it in real life, I won’t put in on the blog. My goal is to inspire you with food that is both approachable AND exciting, whether you’re cooking for yourself, your family, your roommates, or your friends. I want you to be so excited about these recipes that you eagerly await 5pm when you can go home from work and start cooking.

            On a related note, I absolutely LOVE seeing the food that you’re making. It will make my day if you tag @pinchofyum in your Instagram photos and stories! We love to shout out our favorites on Fridays with our Reader Awards on Instagram Stories.</p>

        <p class="lead">My site features Easy Carb Conscious Recipes, with options for Low Carb and Keto diets, as well as other ways of eating including Gluten Free, Dairy Free, Vegetarian (including Vegan), and the original South Beach Diet (which includes both phase one and phase two).
            <hr> You can use diet-type icons above the title on every recipe to see which diets I think the recipe is suitable for.The site has a great Recipe Index where you can look for recipes by Course, Diet Type, Cooking Method, or Ingredient.

            There’s a Filtered Recipe Search which lets you select search parameters from ingredients, diet-types, courses, and methods to find just the perfect recipe for the ingredients you have and your personal dietary needs! Here is the welcome post for the updated site with complete instructions for using Filtered Recipe Search.
            
            If you’re following a certain eating plan, use the Diet-Type Index to help you find recipes for the type of diet you prefer.
            
            On Fridays I feature my personal favorite recipes and you can find those in a category called Friday Favorites.
            
            I don’t promote products for payment but you can find my favorite products that I purchase myself featured at csFoods.
            
            And my weekly Recipe Round-Ups will show you a group of related recipes from csFoods (and sometimes from around the web) to give you lots of options!</p>
